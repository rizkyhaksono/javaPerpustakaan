# Java Perpustakaan

**Clone and run for a quick way to see Java Perpustakaan in action.**

This is a minimal CRUD application based on the [CRUD JAVA](https://github.com/kelasterbuka/JAVA_dasar_programming) within the Java documentation.

A basic CRUD Perpustakaan application needs just these files:

- `database.txt` - Points to the app's main database file and lists its details.
- `Main.java` - Starts the app and creates a program to your command prompt

You can learn more about each of these components within the [CRUD JAVA](https://github.com/kelasterbuka/JAVA_dasar_programming)
